<section class="fullLyrics">
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair 
<br> Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
<br>Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
<br>My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night
<br>There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
<br>And I was thinkin' to myself, "This could be heaven or this could be hell"
<br>Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
<br>There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say
<br> "Welcome to the Hotel California
<br>Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
<br>Such a lovely face
<br>Plenty of room at the Hotel California
<br>Any time of year (any time of year)
<br>You can find it here"
<br>Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes-Benz, uh
<br>She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends
<br>How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
<br>Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
<br>So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"
<br>He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"
<br>And still, those voices are calling from far away
<br>Wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say
<br> "Welcome to the Hotel California
<br>Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
<br>Such a lovely face
<br>They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
<br>What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
<br>Bring your alibis"
<br>Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
<br>And she said, "We are all just prisoners here of our own device"
<br>And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
<br>They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast
<br>Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
<br>I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
<br> "Relax, " said the night man, "We are programmed to receive
<br>You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave"
